Overall, the key contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

 * The development of advanced transformer based UNet model called SegFormer
based UNet for ICH Segmentation using CT scans.

 * Comparing the proposed SegFormer based UNet with the state-of-the-art models on
PhysioNet dataset and performance evaluation using the Evaluation Metrics namely
Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Coefficient (DC).
